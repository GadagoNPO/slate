# Introduction

Welcome to the TAB new app API.

This is a good sum-up about good practice for APIs : [http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api](http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api)
It is very close from what I already did in the past. I will add few other links here that are pertinent on 
this matter.

Plan for the urls :

  - staging with data mocking : https://api-staging.tokyoartbeat.com/api/v0/  [note v0]

  - staging : https://api-staging.tokyoartbeat.com/api/v1/

  - production : https://api.tokyoartbeat.com/api/v1/

In the following documentation I will use : https://api-staging.tokyoartbeat.com/api/v0/ everywhere, please use accordingly.
