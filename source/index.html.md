# Introduction

Welcome to the TAB new app API.

This is a good sum-up about good practice for APIs : http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api
It is very close from what I already did in the past. I will add few other links here that are pertinent on 
this matter.

This is the first version of the doc (2016-07-28), urls, parameters etc... might changed. This is some work in progress.
Curl references are obviously not working yet...

I am not describing yet the authentication as we have not decided yet how we are going to do it.
